        Determines proper ranks for worker processes. The rank assignment

        1. Each agent writes its configuration(group_rank, group_world_size
           , num_workers) to the common store.
        2. Each agent retrieves configuration for all agents
           and performs two level sort using role and rank.
        3. Determine the global rank: the global rank of the workers for the current
           agent is the offset of the infos array up to group_rank of the agent.
           The offset is computed as a sum of local_world_size of all agents that
