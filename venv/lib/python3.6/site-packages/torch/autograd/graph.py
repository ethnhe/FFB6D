class saved_tensors_hooks():
    """Context-manager that sets a pair of pack / unpack hooks for saved tensors.

    Use this context-manager to define how intermediary results of an operation
    should be packed before saving, and unpacked on retrieval.

    In that context, the ``pack_hook`` function will be called everytime an
    operation saves a tensor for backward (this includes intermediary results
    saved using
    :func:`~torch.autograd.function._ContextMethodMixin.save_for_backward` but
    also those recorded by a PyTorch-defined operation). The output of
    ``pack_hook`` is then stored in the computation graph instead of the
    original tensor.

    The ``unpack_hook`` is called when the saved tensor needs to be accessed,
    namely when executing :func:`torch.Tensor.backward()` or
    :func:`torch.autograd.grad()`. It takes as argument the *packed* object
    returned by ``pack_hook`` and should return a tensor which has the same
    content as the original tensor (passed as input to the corresponding
    ``pack_hook``).

    The hooks should have the following signatures:

        pack_hook(tensor: Tensor) -> Any

        unpack_hook(Any) -> Tensor

    where the return value of ``pack_hook`` is a valid input to ``unpack_hook``.

    In general, you want ``unpack_hook(pack_hook(t))`` to be equal to ``t`` in terms
    of value, size, dtype and device.

    Example::

        >>> def pack_hook(x):
        ...     print("Packing", x)
        ...     return x
        >>>
        >>> def unpack_hook(x):
        ...     print("Unpacking", x)
        ...     return x
        >>>
        >>> a = torch.ones(5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> b = torch.ones(5, requires_grad=True) * 2
        >>> with torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks(pack_hook, unpack_hook):
        ...     y = a * b
        Packing tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
        Packing tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.])
        >>> y.sum().backward()
        Unpacking tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
        Unpacking tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.])

    .. warning ::
        Performing an inplace operation on the input to either hooks may lead

    .. warning ::

        context-manager is not yet supported.

class save_on_cpu():
    """Context-manager under which tensors saved by the forward pass will be
    stored on cpu, then retrieved for backward.

    When performing operations within this context manager, intermediary
    results saved in the graph during the forward pass will be moved to CPU,
    then copied back to the original device when needed for the backward pass.
    If the graph was already on CPU, no tensor copy is performed.

    when your model doesn't fit in GPU memory during training).

    Args:
        pin_memory (bool): If ``True`` tensors will be saved to CPU pinned memory
                           during packing and copied to GPU asynchronously during unpacking.
