#  This set of data was set up simply to study the computation
#  and reporting of the vertices of Voronoi cells.
#
#  In particular, the data was selected so that the point
#
#    ( 0.4, 0.5 )
#
#  has a Voronoi cell with vertices:
#
#    ( 0.3, 0.3 ), ( 0.5, 0.4 ), ( 0.5, 0.7 ), ( 0.3, 0.6 ).
#
#  Spatial dimension M =      2
#  Number of points N =     9
