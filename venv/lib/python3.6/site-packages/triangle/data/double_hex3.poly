#  Discussion:
#
#    This file describes a rectangular region with two hexagonal holes.
#    It describes a problem provided by Jeff Borggaard of Virginia Tech.
#
#    The entire region is a subset of the unit square.
#
#    There are 16 nodes, 4 on the outer boundary and 6 on each of
#    the two hexagons.
