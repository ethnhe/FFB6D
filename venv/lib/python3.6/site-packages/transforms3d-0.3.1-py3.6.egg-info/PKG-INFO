        Code to convert between various geometric transformations.
        
        * Composing rotations / zooms / shears / translations into affine matrix;
        * Decomposing affine matrix into rotations / zooms / shears / translations;
        * Conversions between different representations of rotations, including:
        
          * 3x3 Rotation matrices;
          * Euler angles;
          * quaternions.
        
        We have tried to document the algorithms carefully and write clear code in the
        hope that this code can be a teaching reference.  We document the math behind
        some of the algorithms using `sympy <http://www.sympy.org>`_ in
        ``transforms3d/derivations``.  We would be very pleased if y'all would like to
        add your own algorithms and derivations - please get a copy of the code from
        https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d and get on down,
        algorithmically.  Feel free to use the github issue tracker and pull request
        system to ask for advice and support.

        Much of the code comes from `transformations.py
        <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/transformations.py.html>`_ by Christoph

        `travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org/matthew-brett/transforms3d>`_ kindly tests
        the code automatically under Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.
        
        We depend on numpy >= 1.5.  You could probably make it work on an earlier
        numpy if you really needed that.
