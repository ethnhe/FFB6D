Caffe2 uses a copyright model similar to Caffe: each contributor holds
copyright over their contributions to Caffe2. The project versioning records
all such contribution and copyright details. If a contributor wants to further
mark their specific copyright on a particular contribution, they should
indicate their copyright solely in the commit message of the change when it is
committed.
